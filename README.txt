ABOUT:
This is a project for my GUI Programming class of Summer Session I 2022. 
This was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Popper, Bootstrap 5.
The project stores the current state uses JavaScript history.back() .
So, if you move away from a page, then go to that same page, data will not be lost.
